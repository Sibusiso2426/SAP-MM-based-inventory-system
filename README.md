# SAP MM – Inventory Management System 📦📊

This project simulates a simplified **SAP Materials Management (MM)** process to manage inventory, procurement, and vendor performance. It’s built using synthetic data and designed to demonstrate core concepts in supply chain management, analytics, and reporting.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Simulate procurement workflows: from **purchase requisition** to **goods receipt**
- Track and manage **inventory levels** for materials
- Analyze **vendor performance** based on delivery and quality metrics
- Create **dashboards and KPIs** for better decision-making

## 🗂️ Dataset Overview

This project uses a synthetic dataset consisting of four Excel sheets:

| Sheet Name         | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| `Material_Master`  | Contains data about items including ID, description, price, unit, and stock level |
| `Vendor_Master`    | Contains vendor IDs, names, countries, and performance ratings |
| `Purchase_Orders`  | Simulates procurement transactions including materials ordered, vendor, quantity, delivery date, and status |
| `Goods_Receipts`   | Tracks deliveries, received quantities, dates, and quality scores for each purchase order |

📁 **Download the dataset:**
